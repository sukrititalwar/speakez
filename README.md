## 🎯 Philosophy

SPEAKEZ is **NOT** an evaluation or grading system. It's a supportive platform that:
- Detects speech patterns (including disorders) without judgment
- Explains where and why speech breaks
- Guides users on how to practice better
- Adapts to personal baselines, not universal standards
- Uses supportive, non-judgmental language throughout

## 🔧 Environment Variables (Optional)

Create `.env.local` for full functionality:

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
YOUTUBE_API_KEY=your_youtube_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

The app works without these - it will use fallback implementations.
